# `07.1` Find Wally :smile:

Have you every played finding wally? I used to play it a lot when I was little, this exercise is a digital version of finding Wally.

# :pencil: Instructions

Please loop this entire array and print the positions where the string "Wally" is found.

### :bulb: Hint
1. You need to add a conditional inside the loop.
2. Wally may be upper case or lowercase, compare both values [using toLowerCase()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compare-the-case-insensitive-strings-in-javascript/)

### :egg: Easter Egg:

What if there is more than one Wally?
