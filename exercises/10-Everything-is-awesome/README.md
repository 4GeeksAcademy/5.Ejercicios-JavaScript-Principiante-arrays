# `10` Everything is awesome

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Compare the item. If it's `1` push the number to the array `return_array`.

2. Compare the item. If it's `0` push the string `'Yahoo'` to the array `return_array` (instead of the number).

For example, for `[0,0,1,1,0]` the output would be:

```js
['Yahoo','Yahoo', 1, 1,'Yahoo']
```

## 💡 Hint:

+ When you push the number `1` to the new array, make sure you push it as a number and not as a string.
